I had some issues with installing on my work laptop, both with windows (tried startup script and manual install, - I think I had permissions issues), and same with WSL Ubuntu (was worth a try!). Sorry I haven't managed to look into this more, my work laptop is currently being fixed for some hardware issues. I'm happy to talk about this sometime if that would be useful/helpful!

(It's good to have everything there, without clicking through to different sections). It would be cool if it was possible to resize the panels, and I think it might be good for non-expert users to have a tutorial video talking through the parameters/settings (the help buttons are clear and great already!). ","The documentation is really detailed, with links within the interface to docs/relevant parts of the wiki. I thought the walkthrough for install was great",Yes,5,"I think FERMO is awesome! Apologies for not trying with my own data- I expected to have MS2 data by now, but I still don't! FERMO will be the first thing that I try after converting to the right format. I'll also present to colleagues in the chemistry team, after getting some trial data from them.
I think there are a lot of different use cases for FERMO, particularly with the work that I am looking to complete over the next few months/years in my project. It's really exciting! I've been looking into linking bigscape presence/absence GCF data with lab antagonism phenotypes to prioritise candidates- it would be super cool to extend this to associate peaks with bigscape presence/absence data- I imagine the GCF presence/absence data can be input as 'bioactivity data' for each GCF, to find peaks associated with the presence of a BGC within a GCF. I imagine it would be possible to do this, iterating through the columns in presence/absence tables generated by BiG-SCAPE. I appreciate that this is probably quite a lot for V1, but I just thought I'd put the idea out there for future releases, I'd be super interested in discussing/being involved and I should have MS2 data soon that could be used as test data with genomes with characterised BGCs/bioactivity data we have generated. I know that this would be a 'blind' association way of doing things as opposed to informed, but I think it would be cool! Apologies if this overlaps with other software that I haven't had chance to try out yet! (Or if it's a bad idea)
